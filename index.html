	<h2 class="text-warning">First there came the shitcoin. Now cometh the shitfork.</h2>

<i>2018 promises to bring with it 1000 Bitcoin shitforks, all racing to become the shittest of them all. A race to the bottom of the barrel.</i>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027065531im_/http://hk.geocities.com/chantaimanwebpage/images/rule.gif" />

<p>The goal of this project is to kick off 2018 with the absolute shittest Bitcoin fork possible. By setting the bar low at the lowest possible point, things can only get better.</p>
<h3>Some features of the shitfork</h3>
	    <div class="text-left mx-auto" style="width:600px;">
	    <ul class="features">
<li>A premine. I don't know how much yet, but no shitfork is complete without a premine. OK, premine is the wrong word, let's call it a midmine from now on.</li>
<li>No ASICs because they are bad for some reason. You know what, let's not even have GPUs.  'member the good old days when you could mine a block of bitcoin on the Dell laptop at work. Those were the days. I 'member.</li>
<li>Ummmm. What else. Thinking…. Thinking…. I know: let's say that this shitfork follows Satoshi's original vision. Yeah. It follows Satoshi's original vision, peer to peer ele……..</li>
