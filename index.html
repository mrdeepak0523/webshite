First there came the shitcoin. Now cometh the shitfork.

2018 promises to bring with it 1000 shitforks, all racing to become the shittest of them all. A race to the bottom of the barrel.

The goal of this project is to kick off 2018 with the absolute shittest fork possible. Set the bar low, and things can only get better.

Some features of the shitfork:
	- A premine. I don't know how much yet, but no shitfork is complete without a premine. OK, premine is the wrong word, let's call it a midmine from now on.
	- No ASICs because they are bad for some reason. You know what, let's not even have GPUs.  'member the good old days when you could mine a block of bitcoin on the Dell laptop at work. Those were the days. I 'member.
	- Ummmm. What else. Thinking…. Thinking…. I know: let's say that this shitfork follows Satoshi's original vision. Yeah. It follows Satoshi's original vision, peer to peer ele……..

This shitfork is proudly endorsed by:
	- His Holiness Roger Ver, protector of Satoshi's original vision™,  commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. 
	- Evan "I swear it was an accident" Duffield
	- Vitalik "we can just roll it back" Buterin
	- Barry Silbert
